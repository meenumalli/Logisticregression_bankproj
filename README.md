# Logisticregression_portugesebank
Objective: To construct a classification model capable of forecasting the success rate of marketing campaigns executed by Portuguese banking institutions. 

This involved sourcing data from Kaggle and implementing various data pre-processing techniques, such as data cleaning, imputation, balancing, and normalization. 

To evaluate the model's effectiveness in predicting marketing campaign outcomes, used the F1-score, a common metric in classification tasks. The model yielded  F1-score of 91%, indicating its proficiency in predicting the success of marketing campaigns. 

This project highlights the potential for banking institutions to make more informed decisions and achieve better results in their marketing campaigns through the application of data-driven strategies
